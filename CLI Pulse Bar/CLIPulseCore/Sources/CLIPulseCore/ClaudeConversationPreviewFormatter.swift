/// Narrow Claude-specific conversation preview for the macOS / iOS
/// Sessions panel. Replaces the earlier generic
/// `TerminalOutputPreviewFormatter` for managed-Claude sessions
/// because the generic chrome filter still leaked TUI noise:
///   * "Processing... / Smooshing... / Crunched for 3s"
///   * "↓ tokens / ↑ tokens" status counters
///   * Bare `[38;2;…m` ANSI fragments that escape the per-event
///     sanitizer when sequences split across event boundaries.
///   * "What would you like toworkon?" — words run together because
///     Claude's TUI repaints with cursor moves between events.
///
/// Strategy: extract ONLY conversation-meaningful lines, drop the
/// rest. Provider-scoped to `claude` since PR #10 managed sessions
/// only support that provider.
///
/// Crucially, this formatter takes the **list** of event payloads
/// rather than running per-event. Claude's TUI scatters output across
/// stdout chunks: a CSI sequence may straddle two events, a multi-line
/// response may split mid-sentence. Concatenating before sanitizing
/// catches both. The downside — words running together when cursor
/// moves are removed between text fragments — is accepted for v1;
/// full terminal emulation is Phase 3 / local-mode work.
///
/// Lines that survive:
///   * Start with `❯ ` AND don't look like Claude's placeholder hint
///     (`❯ Try "..."`).
///   * Start with `⏺ ` (Claude assistant response marker).
///   * Look like an error / login surface (case-insensitive substring
///     match against `Error`, `API`, `Please run`, `Warning`,
///     `Unauthorized`, `authentication_error`, `not authenticated`,
///     `invalid auth`).
///
/// Everything else drops, including:
///   * box-drawing borders (U+2500..U+257F)
///   * separator runs (──── / ----)
///   * "Processing..." / "Smooshing..." / "Crunched for…" / "Brewed…"
///   * "↓ N tokens" / "↑ N tokens" / "running sp hook"
///   * status bar: "esc to interrupt", "/effort", "for shortcuts"
///   * spinner glyphs
///   * isolated punctuation / glyph fragments
///   * orphan ANSI body fragments like "[38;2;215;119;87m"
